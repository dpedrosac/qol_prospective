# Understanding Quality of Life in Parkinson's Disease

## About This Project

Welcome!

For this project, a questionnaire was developed and distributed to subjects suffering from Parkinson's Disease (PD). To analyse the obtained data, we used R scripts with the goal of enhancing our understanding of Quality of Life (QoL) in people with PD.

Quality of Life can mean different things to different people. The Federal Centre for Health Education defines quality of life as:

> "...the individual perception of living conditions and the associated well-being."

Currently, there is no standardised concept of quality of life for Parkinson's disease, and it remains unclear what this truly means for those living with the condition. Existing questionnaires, such as the PDQ-39, focus heavily on disease-specific experiences, often neglecting other critical dimensions of life quality.

This project originates from the "Movement Disorders and Neuromodulation" working group at the Department of Neurology at Philipps University of Marburg. Building upon prior research from this group, we developed an anonymous online questionnaire that collects data on:

- Disease characteristics
- Sociodemographic factors
- The subjective relevance of various dimensions of quality of life (e.g., social connections, mobility)

The project aims to address two key research questions:

1. Which dimensions of quality of life are particularly relevant for people with Parkinson's disease, and which are not?
2. Are there differences in the evaluation of these dimensions between patient groups with different sociodemographic characteristics?
